# Problem Statement 1:

Write the program in NodeJs using plain javascript to find the combinations of numbers from
an array, where addition of any two numbers from the array is a number from the same
array.
Ex: arr = [ 2, 3, 11, 30, 3, 1, 4, 14, 27, 17, 5 ]
So from this array, the combinations could be,
2, 3, 5 (as 2 + 3 = 5)
1, 3, 4
3, 14, 17
And so one ...
The user should be able to pass a list of numbers as an input array to the program.
The output should be the combinations printed on the console.
It is expected to find the optimal solutions both for time complexity and space complexity.
There could be multiple solutions. For all the solutions it is expected to showcase the base
case and the worst case scenario.
